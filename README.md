# TeX Gyre Parliamentary
Typeset draft bills like a pro! (UK)

## Executive Summary
For those who want to typeset in the style of UK legislation, I have created a clone of the Book Antiqua Parliamentary typeface used for the official publication of statutes.  This is also useful for those who don't like Palatino/Book Antiqua's native quotation marks.


## Details

This font contains precisely one modification to the `newpx` font OTF files created by Michael Sharpe, which in turn are modified versions of TexGyrePagella (created by GUST and under their eponymous licence), which in even more turn, is a clone of Hermann Zapf's masterpiece, Palatino (aka Book Antiqua). I then also expanded the coverage of Greek and Cyrillic with charactesr from D B Miller's Domitian typeface This modification  the replacement of quotation marks (single and double) in TeX Gyre PagellaX with those of TeX Gyre TermesX (Michael Sharpe's modified version of GUST's clone of Times New Roman), to  exactly replicate the 'Book Antiqua Parliamentary' typeface used in typing UK legislation, which was modified by Parliament along precisely the same lines as this typeface.  Book Antiqua Parliamentary is not publicly available; hence, I created this typeface.  It also fulfils the need for clearer punctuation marks than the default ones in Palatino (and similar); see, eg, [this StackExchange thread](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/359899/can-one-change-the-font-used-by-csquotes).
